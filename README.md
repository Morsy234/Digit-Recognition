# Digit-Recognition
 - Developed a robust digit recognition system by creating a neural network model to recogonize- digits from 0 to 9.
 - Created effective PyTorch model for digit recognition trained using my own training loop with Gradient stochastic
 descent Optimizer and Cross Entropy Loss Function.
 - The system gives outputs of training and validation loss and accuracy
